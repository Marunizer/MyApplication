# My Android Application
Draft version of AR MENU SAD APP

This repository is a prototype for my Senior Design Teams project, Android Version

# Currently runnable ?
Yes.

 Except issues may arise when compiling native-lib.cpp, the Draco library is not included

Why?
In the middle of setting up the Decompression system from Draco (https://github.com/google/draco) 

using Draco involves using C/C++ natively within Android Studio to be called by a JAVA Activity. 

There are some struggles working with the NDK, but I'm on the case as we speak ! ;) 

Besides Draco decompression, the rest is up and running
